#you need to print out a greeting "Good morning, Ms. Johnson!" (without the quotes) calling the print() function only once and specifying its keyword arguments,
# without adding any other strings. How would you do that?

adj = "Good"
part_of_day = "morning"
comma = ","
title = "Ms."
surname = "Johnson"

# your print() function
print(adj+" " + part_of_day+comma+" " + title+" " +surname,end="!")
